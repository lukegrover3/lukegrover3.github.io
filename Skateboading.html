<h1>Skateboarding</h1>
<h3>I have been skateboarding since I was 15 years old when for christmas I got a longboard. A type of skateboard that almost mimics the feel of surfing. I spent many many hours in the driveway and road infront of my house, make countless carves and attempting countless tricks.</h3>
