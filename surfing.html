<h1>Surfing</h1>
<h3>I have been surfing all over New England, including some parts of canada. I began surfing when I was 12 years old, for the first couple seasons only surfing during summer, spring, and fall. However after enough time saving money, I was able to buy my very own winter wetsuit which enabled me to surf year round. Recently I have even began working for the same surf camp that I myself learned from, and I am now getting to pass on the gift of surfing. </h3>
